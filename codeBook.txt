General information:

The rawdata was acquired from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals of a Samsung SII cellphone.
These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another
low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequency domain signals.
